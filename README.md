# Cellular Automata #

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton): 

> A cellular automaton (pl. cellular automata, abbrev. CA) is 
> a discrete model studied in computer science, mathematics, physics, complexity 
> science, theoretical biology and microstructure modeling.

The purpose of this project is to explore the world of Cellular Automata and 
add onto the base implementation to see how things like viruses, bacteria, 
DNA-like traits, food, poison, and other things affect how Automata interact.

This is just a fun personal project, feel free to use it as you like!

The base of the GUI for this project is taken from https://github.com/sgelb/gameoflife
